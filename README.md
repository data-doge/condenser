# text visualizer

### sketch

displays a sample of text no longer than a certain amount of characters, with lines broken so that the text fits exactly into a circle.

text scrolls from left to right at a speed you get to determine.

the bottom bit is highlighted and the font is a bit bigger inside a box or something.

this box holds a sentence, and some quality of the box will change based on characteristics of the sentence. the characteristics might be, sentiment, similarity of words, length, dunno.

whenever we reach a punctuation mark, or some other significant character, a small line will dart across the screen.
