# text visualizer

### sketch v2

displays a sample of text no longer than a certain amount of characters, with lines broken so that the text fits exactly into a diamond.

text scrolls from left to right at a speed you get to determine.

the middle line in the diamond is displayed again somewhere below the diamond, underlined.

some quality of the underlined bit will change based on characteristics of the sentence, things like sentiment, similarity of words, length, dunno.

whenever we reach a punctuation mark, or some other significant character, a small line will dart across the screen.
